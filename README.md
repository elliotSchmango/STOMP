# STOMP  - Scalable Telemetry/Operations ML Platform
## By Elliot Hong

STOMP is a modular, scalable, and real-time machine learning platform for monitoring telemetry data, detecting anomalies, and providing business intelligence dashboards powered by Grafana and Prometheus. In this project, STOMP specifically focuses on **engine telemetry data** (e.g., from aircraft or turbine systems). It ingests multivariate sensor streams (temperature, RPM, vibration, etc.), analyzes them in real-time for anomalies, and displays metrics and alerts through a Grafana-based interface. However, the highly modularizable design allows for easy data/ML model swapping.
